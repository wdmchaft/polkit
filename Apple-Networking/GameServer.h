//CLASS INTERFACES:

/*
This class implements the server side of a multiplayer game.
It can be connected to one or more clients which are represented as instances of the GamePeer class.
You can then communicate with the clients using either TCP (for reliability) or UDP (for speed) protocols.
The server can be registered for automatic discovery by GameClients on the local network using Bonjour.
