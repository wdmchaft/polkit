#
# This script replaces __NAME__, __VERSION__ and __SVN_REVISION__ by their actual values in the Info.plist and InfoPlist.strings files for the target
# 
# The project file must have a "version" SVN property defined as such:
# > svn propset version 1.0b1 Myproject.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
#
# To use in a target, add a script phase with this single line:
# ${SRCROOT}/PolKit/Scripts/ProcessInfoPlists.sh
